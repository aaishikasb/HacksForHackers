# NPX Card Generator
Create an npx Business Card in seconds!

## Inspiration 💡
npx Cards have been around for a long time, but all the tutorials out on the internet are outdated. Plus, do you really want to handle the headache of managing deprecated modules to make your card work? Or do you really want to rummage around on Stack Overflow trying to debug why things don't work? We just wanted to make it easy for beginner developers to build their npx cards in under a minute!

## What it does 🧭
NPX Card Generator is a terminal tool that accepts input from the user with the details they want to have on their npx Card to generate a new file housing the code, that can be published using simple easy to follow steps.

## How to use it? 🤔
We'll update the README on GitHub with instructions on how to use this!

## How we built it 🔧
We built NPX Card Generator using Node.js from scratch within, hold your breath, **3 hours**. It was a crazy idea with a crazier deadline but it works! Our dependencies include Chalk, Boxen, and Inquirer, which were used to create the template and the initial prompts!

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
 - We used 100% of our brain and crashed.
 - Adding the new output to a different file was a challenge.
 - We found out about the hackathon 3 hours before the deadline, so it was definitely a race against time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
 - Honestly just finishing the project before the final submission.
 - Getting the output and code super fast!

## What we learned 🧠
 - Using Inquirer to generate Terminal Prompts.
 - Dealing with Pure ESM Packages in general.

## What's next for NPX Card Generator ⏭
We will continue to build the project even after the hackathon ends as the feedback we have received from our fellow developer friends is great! Would love to make it more customisable without making it complex!
